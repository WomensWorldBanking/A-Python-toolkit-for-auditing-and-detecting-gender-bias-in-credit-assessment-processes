    "##### Project background: \n",
    "Women’s World Banking, in partnership with the University of Zurich (UZH) and support from data.org, set out on a two-year technical assistance project with three financial institutions based in India, Mexico, and Colombia. With each institution, we conducted a thorough gender bias audit across either their entire credit portfolio or a particular credit product line/product. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in creating this GitHub page is to convey our insights from these three collaborations and share the approach to auditing gender bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Who is the audience for this toolkit?\n",
    "This toolkit is an open-source package associated with the “Check Your Bias! A Field Guide for Lenders” report (available on Women’s World Banking website). It is specifically developed for professionals who are familiar with data science and Python programming and are interested in advocating for fair lending. Examples include data scientists working with financial services providers, coders, risk specialists, and finance professionals who facilitate credit access.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prerequisites for using this toolkit: \n",
    "a. Statistical foundations: Familiarity with multiple linear regression, logistic regression, foundations of causal inference, regression discontinuity, and matching techniques.\n",
    "b. A working knowledge of:\n",
    "- How to write a function in Python\n",
    "- How to use Python packages such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy, and statsmodel\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python data structures  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is the core question we are trying to answer in this toolkit?\n",
    "“Is a particular credit product fair for women applicants?” \n",
    "\n",
    "This question is placed at the core of our approach to auditing for gender bias. To have an acceptable and precise response to this question, an institution needs to have a clear understanding of fairness, bias, and how/where a range of biases may arise. We start a quick overview of these concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defining and measuring fairness\n",
    "Fairness is an intricate and multidimensional concept. Its definition depends on both context and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each institution needs to develop/adopt a definition of fairness that everyone within the organization understands and supports. By referring to its own definition of fairness, an institution can benchmark its progress and assess the relative risks of bias. We do not go into the dozens of definitions of fairness here. Instead, we recommend the interested readers to look into the Verma and Rubin (2018) paper on definitions of fairness (https://fairware.cs.umass.edu/papers/Verma.pdf). In broad terms, however, approaches to measuring fairness can be separated into 1) those that promote group-level fairness and 2) those that move towards individual-level fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group-based fairness measurement rests on the logic of treating different groups equally. They aggregate the measurement values for each pair of groups and compare the unconditional outcomes of a classification algorithm for those groups. The group that an individual belongs to is indicated by its sensitive attribute. In our case, the sample split and comparison is between women and men applicants. Most approaches to evaluating group-based fairness use metrics based on the binary classification confusion matrix to define fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual-based fairness measurement rests on the assumption that similar individuals should be treated as similarly as possible. Analyses falling under an individual-based approach try to demonstrate fairness (or the lack thereof) by identifying treatment differences between nearly identical groups of people. In practice, this is commonly done through highly conditional analyses, including those that use quasi-experimental (or even experimental) approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway: An institution needs to develop/adopt its own definition of fairness based on its strategic goals and cultural contexts. Ways of measuring fairness—including individual-level and group-level fairness—can fit a range of definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is bias?\n",
    "In this toolkit, when we talk about bias we are referring to unfair bias or discrimination. Under a discriminatory process, some prioritized groups receive a systematic advantage, and other groups are placed at a systematic disadvantage. Biases can be based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex (including gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), age, physical or mental disability, veteran status, genetic information, citizenship, or other distinguishing factors. Among all these biases, we focus exclusively on gender bias. Throughout this toolkit, bias refers to gender bias, but the toolkit can be adapted to a range of biases including those listed above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fairness in lending\n",
    "We briefly explained what bias and fairness are. Gender-based bias in lending happens when a credit process makes credit decisions that are systemically prejudiced against certain people or groups of different genders. This type of bias stems from a variety of sources. Loan officers can exhibit bias as they assess creditworthiness through interviews and observation. Algorithms assessing applicants' creditworthiness can introduce bias. Other times, data itself can be imbalanced and introduce bias to the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how to assess fairness in credit portfolios, we focus on approved and rejected credit applications and do not include pending, missing, or withdrawal cases in the audit bias practice. Taking this approach, we consider fairness among:\n",
    "a. Approved applicants: Those applicants who have received credit may receive unfair credit decisions related to credit offers (loan approval), credit scores, loan terms (loan amount, interest rate, and collateral), and loan maturity.\n",
    "b. Rejected applicants: Those applicants who have not received credit may have been unfairly denied credit due to their gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those looking for a simple way to start (without having to use more advanced statistical techniques), Women’s World Banking and University of Zurich designed a scorecard for any type of lender to use to assess fairness across six common dimensions. Paying attention to these indicators, particularly over time, will offer institutions the opportunity to identify areas for improvement. Since not all credit processes are the same, the list of fairness-related questions that an institution will ask might vary, and we hope institutions will interpret and adapt these questions to their needs. The six dimensions of fairness in the scorecard are: credit score, approval rate, credit amount, interest rate, collateral amount, and characteristics of rejected candidates. To read the complete descriptions of these dimensions and how to measure them use the following link: https://www.womensworldbanking.org/insights-and-impact/check-your-bias-gender-bias-scorecard-for-lenders/\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A short introduction to key credit concepts:\n",
    "- Credit risk: The probability of a loss resulting from a borrower failing to meet contractual credit obligations.\n",
    "- Credit score: A numerical expression of a credit applicant's perceived risk, predicting the creditworthiness of an individual. Can be based on a credit report coming a credit bureau or can be based on a financial service provider's internal calculations and risk modeling. \n",
    "- Loan performance: An indicator of whether a customer is (or group of customers are) making their loan installments on time and in full, or whether a customer is (or group of customers are) in default, measured against the obligations defined in the credit contract. \n",
    "- In this toolkit, we use the terms \"credit\" and \"loan\" interchangeably. "

    "One common way of risk categorization is to categorize applicants into low risk, medium risk, and high risk. Applicants categorized as low risk may receive credit approval without the necessity of going through any further investigation.\n",
    "Medium-risk applicants may receive home visits or video calls to obtain additional information (e.g., on their sources of income, upcoming expenses, etc.). With the risk categorization and these additional pieces of information, a loan officer makes the final credit decision. Applicants with high credit risk are likely to be rejected, with a portion being offered the opportunity to go through an interview process, after which they sometimes receive a loan. These high-risk applicants often need a guarantor or collateral, provided they get loan disbursement approval.\n",

    "\n",
    "Positive and negative balance tests are among the most fundamental bias audit tests, and are used to \n",
    "estimate the significance of the difference between two numbers. A positive (or negative) balance test on model/credit scores, for example, aims to test whether the approved (or rejected) male and female credit applicants exhibit statistically significant differences in their scores. A positive balance test would apply to the applicants who are approved, while a negative balance test would apply to the applicants who are rejected. To run a positive balance test, the auditor compares the average model / credit score of approved men vs. approved women using a two sample t-test. The negative balance test uses the same construct among rejected applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the differences between men and women's average model scores, we can use two sample T-Test. \n",
    "For approved and rejected applicants, we conduct separate tests. Python scipy package has a method called \n",

    "equal_var: if True, perform a standard independent 2 sample t-test that assumes equal population variances. \n",
    "If False, perform Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal population variances. This is True by default.\n",
    "Before we perform the test, we need to decide if we’ll assume the two populations have equal variances or not. \n",
    "As a rule of thumb, we can assume the populations have equal variances if the ratio of the larger sample \n",
    "variance to the smaller sample variance is less than 4.  \n",
    "Here, our code takes care of this part and calculates the variance ratio and based on that, automatically decides\n",

    "##### How to audit gender fairness of credit approval and non-performing loans (NPLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand if there is a strong relationship between the “gender” variable and some categorical credit terms, such as credit approval or non-performing loans (NPLs), an auditor can use classification techniques such as logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression (also known as a logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure. This is also commonly known as the log of odds ratio, or the natural logarithm of odds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other regression models, logistic regression allows for adding further control variables to take into account other relevant characteristics of the applicants (e.g., demographics, risk factors, requested loan characteristics, etc.), apart from gender, that may explain differential outcomes. The assessment is unconditional if it does not account for control variables (i.e., a test of group-level fairness), and conditional if it accounts for control variables (i.e., a test of individual-level fairness). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Auditing for gender bias in credit approval. In other words, we are trying to understand if there are any biases in the FSP's credit approval that gender can explain it.\n",
    "To answer this question using logistic regression, we can rephrase the question and ask 'does gender predict the likelihood of credit approval' (to be more precise, the log of odds ratio of approval)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression model structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "DV: Credit/loan approval (DV = 1, if approved and DV = 0 if rejected)\n",
    "EVs: \n",
    "    a. In an unconditional model: Gender  \n",
    "    b. In a conditional model: Gender, new applicant or renewal, (income - expenses), demographics, has any credit bureau data (0/1), verification checks etc.\n",

    "#### 2.3. Auditing for Group- or Individual-level fairness using linear regression.\n",
    "##### How to audit gender fairness of credit scores, credit amount, interest rate, collateral amount, and other credit terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "Linear regression techniques look for patterns, or “linear” relationships, between explanatory variables (EV) and dependent variables (DV). There are many kinds of linear regression techniques. One type of regression is called least squares. To understand if there is a strong relationship between the “female” variable and a specific credit term (e.g., credit amount, interest rate, collateral amount etc.), relative to male applicants, an auditor can use least squares regression and regress the desired credit outcome on gender. To make the connection between using regression and detecting bias, let us have a quick recall on our definition of gender bias in a credit process. 'Gender-based credit bias happens when a credit process creates results that are systemically prejudiced against certain people, for reasons related to  gender'. In other words, in a fair scenario, gender must not contribute to any predictions on any loan terms. Now, it should be clearer how we are going to use regression for auditing bias. If you can regress a credit term on gender and observe statistically and economically significant relationships, this is indicative of an unconditional gender bias in the portfolio (i.e., a test of \"group-level fairness\"). Furthermore, we then recommend setting up increasingly conditional analyses that take into account other relevant characteristics of the applicants (e.g., demographics, risk factors, requested loan characteristics, etc.), apart from gender, that may explain differential outcomes. For purposes of bias auditing, this moves closer towards measuring whether a lender is achieving “individual-level fairness”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "Auditing for gender bias in loan amount. In other words, we are trying to understand if there are any biases in the FSP's credit approval amount that gender can explain.\n",
    "To answer this question using regression, let us rephrase the question and ask 'does gender predict the approved loan amount?'\n",
    "Using regression to answer 'does gender predict the approved loan amount?'\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one could raise the following questions about other loan terms and use regression to audit gender bias in each term. \n",

    "A comment on using EVs:\n",
    "Although the list of EVs may vary between different FSP, there are a couple of EVs that we recommend to add to your model.  Specifically, if you are working in a developing economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "New applicant or renewal: Some FSPs may assess new applicants and old applicant's creditworthiness using different processes and techniques. Most likely that would be the case, since an FSP would have more data on its old customers compared to the new applicants. Therefore, when auditing bias, it is important not to consider the portfolio as a single homogenous group. To address this point, you can split the portfolio into different segments and assess fairness in each segment separately or you can add a categorical variable to represent each segment of your model. The latter is the approach we have taken in our modeling approach.\n",
    " \n",
    "Demographics: Age, economic characteristics, and household size are examples of such variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Has any credit bureau data: due to a variety of reasons, it is common to see a low-income customer with no record and historical data in credit bureaus. Lack of required information or information asymmetry can create biases and algorithms or loan officers may treat such customers differently. Therefore, in your bias audit practice, it is helpful to create and use a binary control variable that shows whether someone has credit bureau information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification checks: Many FSPs ask for their loan officers' input when assessing an applicant's creditworthiness. However, to keep the costs down and be more efficient, they may put an extra verification mandate (home visit, business visit, interview ...) on customers that the FSP is uncertain about their repayment capacity. We recommend adding a binary control variable into your model to flag those customers who have received visits. Working with an FSP partner, we saw that women applicants are more likely to receive more home visits and the chance that a women applicant gets rejected after a home visit was higher compared to a man applicant with the same financial credentials! Therefore, we recommend adding such a control variable to your model to let you detect such scenarios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If necessary, you can check the interaction effect between gender and control variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the way that we have set our regression model to answer to 'Does gender predict the loan amount requested?' question.  \n",
    "Note: The unit of observation is at the individual application level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guide on how to read the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "b: estimated regression coefficient\n",
    "se: standard error of b\n",
    "(number): numbers in parentheses show the output of a model. '(1)' shows the model containing only one variable, gender - unconditional model. Models '(2)' - model '(8)', show the conditional models. In model '(2)', we have added the application month as the only control variable, in model (3), we have added both application month and New applicant or renewal variables. Taking the same logic, model '(8)', contains all the seven control variables.\n",

    "#### 2.4. Auditing for individual-level fairness using regression discontinuity:\n",
    "##### Using a quasi-experimental approach to audit gender fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a quasi experimental design that is typically used to determine the causal effects of interventions by comparing outcomes for observations where there are (arbitrary) cutoffs or thresholds above or below which an intervention is assigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that observations lying closely on either side of the thresholds are likely to have much more similar characteristics, which increases the validity of the comparison. In our case, we co-opt the method for purposes of bias assessment by testing whether women and men applicants appear to show different discontinuities (e.g., in terms of approval rates or loan terms) around key credit score or risk thresholds of the lender. Many lenders use some form of credit score-- whether external or in-house--to segment borrowers into different risk categories, which have bearing on loan approval and/or loan terms to be provided. For some lenders, we find that these can often be “fuzzy” thresholds (e.g., they provide minimum requirements but do not always equate with automated loan approval) and/or that approval or provided loan terms take into consideration additional human decisions (e.g., in the case of hybrid credit assessment approaches). In such cases, RDD can provide an intuitive method for assessing bias across a range of outcomes. Broadly speaking, the approach can be separated into two steps. First, the auditor should identify any cutoff or risk thresholds that are used by the lender for decisions on approval or loan terms. For example, credit scores may be categorized into high, medium, or low risk. This categorization is a subjective exercise that is dependent on the actual process of a given lender (there is a sample piece of code in the appendix section that shows how you yourself can create risk categories). The second step is to audit for gender bias in each category. The bias audit can leverage a range of statistical methods, but we generally suggest using least squares regression for any continuous dependent variables and logit regression for any binary dependent variables. The goal is to assess whether men and women applicants who are close to the cutoff points—and who would be assumed to be fairly similar to one another—have a different likelihood of approval or other loan terms such as loan amount, interest rate, or loan tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below provides a template for how an auditor could use RDD to assess the presence of gender bias by comparing approval rates for men and women who are right above and below a hypothetical minimum approval threshold. In the example, the RDD model is re-run using varying windows around the minimum approval threshold (e.g., +/- 15, 30, 45, and 60 points) to test for robustness of the results. Working with our FSP partners, we used +/- 15, 30, 45, and 60 points as bandwidths. That being said, an auditor may need to pick other bandwidths for the audit process. The RDD can also be run conditionally, through the addition of other relevant controls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the model output (reflected in the table below), the auditor can compare women to men; differences in the regression coefficient (indicating differences in magnitude between windows); and how these change with the presence or absence of further control variables.\n",
