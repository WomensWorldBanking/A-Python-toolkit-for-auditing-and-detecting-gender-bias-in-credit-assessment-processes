This repository contains two modules that can help financial service providers (FSPs) to detect gender biases in a credit product portfolio.

Module 1: This module (auditing fairness among approved credit applicants) helps an auditor to detect gender bias among approved credit applicants.

Module 2: This module (auditing fairness among rejected credit applicants) helps an auditor to detect gender bias among rejected credit applicants.

Besides providing the code, in each module, we have provided some examples to help the user better understand how he/she/they can use this toolkit. In these examples, we have used a dummy dataset that we have built specifically for this toolkit. You can find the data (df_dummy) as well as the code to build this dataset (Create_Dummy_Data) in the project GitHub page. You do not need to use the Create_Dummy_Data file to run module 1 and module 2. However, we have shared this code for those users who are interested to learn how we have created our dummy dataset.
